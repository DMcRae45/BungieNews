        Each week you need to add a critique or summary of the work in your web site / portfolio. 
        This week you are asked to critique an HTML5 Framework. The following features need to be included.

        1.At the heart of HTML5 frameworks is a grid system. Compare the grid systems for 2 frameworks. How do these frameworks support responsive web design.

        2.Menu systems are often a bind to get right especially if you want a multi-dropdown menu. 
        In an ideal world you should write the HTML for a menu as a set of hierarchical un-numbered lists. 
        Using this as your HTML, see how your chosen framework renders this. Critisise the implementation of Menus in your chosen HTML5 framework.

        3.Pick out 5 features, other than grid and menu, that your chosen framework supports and comment on their usefulness.
