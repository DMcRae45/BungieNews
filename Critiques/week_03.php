                You need to add 400 words of appraisal of the work carried out this week. 
                Discuss how you have implemented an API within your ‘article’ database table. 
                Using some of your code as examples, indicate what advantage the API gives to 
                your software. Is the API a good idea? The answer is YES, give a couple of 
                reasons why.
